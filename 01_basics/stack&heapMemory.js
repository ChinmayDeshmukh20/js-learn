//prmitive datatypes -> String , Number , Boolean , Null , undefined , Symbol , BigInt
//Non-primitive datatypes(aka Reference types) -> Array , Objects, Functions

//Types of memory - stack & heap memory
// Primitive types are stored in Stack && non-primitives in Heap
// Whenever we create anything in Stack memory we get copy of that to play with && 
//whenever we create in Heap memory we get refernce of it , so whatever we do , it directly gets changed in original declarations
